# Fraud-Detection-System-for-Financial-Transactions-
Fraud Detection System for Financial Transactions | Month 1 ProjectBuilt a real-time fraud detection pipeline using ML techniques on historical transaction data.

Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | SQL | Streamlit | Jupyter
Key Highlights:
• Addressed severe class imbalance using SMOTE
• Engineered time/amount/behavior-based features
• Trained models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees & XGBoost
• Tuned models via GridSearchCV, optimized with AUC-ROC & F1-score
• Deployed an interactive dashboard in Streamlit for live fraud predictions
• Documented challenges, risk areas, and future improvements

Outcome: Built a deployable, ML-based fraud detection pipeline that simulates real-world banking use cases.
