# Fraud-Detection-System-for-Financial-Transactions-
Developed a Project on
Fraud Detection System for Financial Transactions 

Built a real-time fraud detection pipeline using ML techniques on historical transaction data.

Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | Streamlit | Jupyter Notebook

Key Highlights:

• Addressed severe class imbalance using SMOTE

• Engineered time/amount/behavior-based features

• Trained models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees & XGBoost

• Tuned models via GridSearchCV, optimized with AUC-ROC & F1-score

• Deployed an interactive dashboard in Streamlit for live fraud predictions

• Documented challenges, risk areas, and future improvements

Outcome: Built a deployable, ML-based fraud detection pipeline that simulates real-world banking use cases.
